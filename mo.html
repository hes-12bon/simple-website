                6 Characteristics of Professional Network Marketers
            </h2></br></br>
            <p1><h4>1. Show up every day and do what is necessary</h4></br>

                They do the WORK even though they may not be in the mood.</br>
                 They take ACTION! Amateurs work when they feel like it.

                <h4>2. Self-Starter </h4></br>

                They don’t need their upline to call and inspire and motivate them. They don’t </br>
                need their hand held. Amateurs wait for someone to inspire them.</br>

            <p3>
                <h4>3. Belief in what they are doing and the products and opportunity they represent.
                </h4></br>

                 Amateurs don’t even use the products they are promoting.</br>
                                                                         
                 <h4>4. Self-Educator</h4></br>

                 In any industry there is a learning curve. Professionals in any industry learn</br>
                  the ins and outs of their field. They stay up to date with the latest news and </br> 
                  training. They are always learning and growing. </br>
                  Amateurs don’t want to be bothered with learning.

            <p4>
                <h4>5. Responsible </h4></br>

                They take responsibility for their own success or failure. They know.</br>
                 “If it is to be, It’s up to ME.” Amateurs blame their failure on the upline,</br>
                  the company, the economy, or a number of other excuses.

            <p5>
                <h4>6. Invest in their Business </h4></br>
                

                From buying and using products to training, advertising, supplies, etc. 
                </br>They invest time and money in their business. </br>
                Amateurs don’t spend time or money on their businesss.</br>

                Pros make extraordinary income because they consistently do what others won’t </br>
                do.
                
                We need the mindset of a professional. </br>
                Every morning, take a moment to think about and visualize yourself as a </br>
                professional network marketer. What are you going to do TODAY that will move you </br>
                forward in your business?</br>
