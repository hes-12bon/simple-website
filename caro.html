            <p2>Network marketers don’t just focus on financial growth, but on all aspects
                 of human interaction and wealth creation.</br>
                I have since adopted a positive attitude on all aspects of my life.
                I have also created a huge network while coaching young people on become 
                financially independent.</br>
                My greatest satisfaction is to see my mentees recognise and appreciate
                 my role in their own success.</br>
                For a long time, many Kenyans have associated network marketing – a business
                 model that relies on person-to- person selling – with fraud, largely due to 
                 misinformation.</br>

                However, Caroline Mwende has transformed her life through that same business
                 model.</br>
                
                For more than four years, she has grown to become one of the most successful 
                network marketers in Kenya.</br>

                <h4>What is network marketing?</h4></br>

                This is a business model where individuals earn commissions for making 
                referrals or bringing in new clients into a business. </br>For example, if you refer someone to
                 a salon you have been to and the salon’s owner pays you, you are
                  a network marketer.</br>

                <h4>What were you doing before you joined this field?</h4></br>

                I was working for an NGO based in Machakos County and I loved my job, but I had
                 to put in very long hours with little pay. It is while working there that I 
                 switched to network marketing.</br>
                 <h4>What motivated you to join the industry?</h4></br>

                I consider myself a risk taker, and that is part of the reason I decided to try 
                it out. My family and friends really discouraged me because they believed </br>that network marketing is not genuine work. However,

                I conducted my research and got started in spite of the dissenting voices.</br>

            <p5>
                <h4>How can one identify a legitimate network marketing business?</h4></br>

                 Most people fall for pyramid schemes because of the online hype.</br> Genuine
                 companies are often long term business entities that are properly registered,
                 provide quality products or services, are tax compliant and have a well</br> outlined 
                 compensation plan and methods of payment. Additionally, they have open
                 communication lines through which complaints can be channelled, and physical </br>
                 addresses too. Pyramid schemes, on the other hand, are short term businesses that 
                 hardly ever last more than six months.</br>

                 <h4>How has this field changed over the last four years? What challenges
                     have you faced?</h4></br>

                 Network marketers don’t just focus on financial growth, but on all aspects of 
                 human interaction and wealth creation.</br> I have since adopted a positive attitude
                 on all aspects of my life. I have also created a huge network while coaching
                 young people on become financially independent.</br> My greatest satisfaction is to
                 see my mentees recognise and appreciate my role in their own success.</br>

                 The biggest challenge I have faced is rejection. Some friends, family and even
                 strangers don’t take my job seriously because they don’t understand it.</br>

                <h4>What makes a network marketer successful? Can anyone do it?</h4></br>
                

              Anyone can be successful in network marketing as long as they work hard and make
              a few sacrifices especially during the initial phase. </br>They should also be willing 
              to help others grow.</br>

              <h4> do you usually spend your work days?</h4></br>

                I am an early riser. I wake up at 5am every day, then I listen to motivational</br>
                talks or podcasts about network marketing and business success before heading to 
                work. From 8am to 7pm, I sit in my office coaching my team, and connecting with new
                business associates online.</br>
                <h4> motivates you to keep going?</h4></br>

                The picture of the life I want for myself and the future generations. </br>I grew 
                up poor, and I feel like it is my responsibility to change that. I wouldn’t want
                 my children to grow up that way. I also want to help others realise their dreams.</br>

                <h4>What do you hope to achieve in the next few years?</h4></br>
                
                I am here to help job seekers become job creators. I want to create a huge
                 movement of Kenyan youth who don’t need to be employed because they are</br> growing
                  their income through business.</br>
                
                  <h4>What do you do to unwind?</h4></br>
                
                I create time to meet new people, make new friends and have fun. I regularly do
                 charity work with my friends, and I enjoy reading, hiking and travelling.</br>
                
                Sometimes I stay indoors, watch a movie, or listen to music.</br>
                
                <h4>Your advice to aspiring network marketers?</h4></br>
                
                Go for it. Choose a company that has the products or services that you like,</br>
                 then get a mentor and be ready to endure the initial challenges as you work 
                 towards success. Be a good student who is patient, hardworking and consistent.</br>
