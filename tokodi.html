                Former NTV journalist Grace Ekirapa has revealed that she was shown
                 the door by the CBD-based media house during her maternity leave.
            </h2>
            <p>
                During a live video on her Instagram page, Ekirapa said that she received a call</br> from her then-bosses asking her to come for a letter.
                
                She had previously had a conversation with her bosses and she knew she would get back</br> to work after the leave.
                
                She said she panicked after the call.</br>
                
                “We had an agreement before I went for maternity and I knew the agreement was this and that</br> and so I was content. I knew there was this possibility and then I get a call. So I told them to scan the letter and send me,” she said.
                
                The mother of one further said that was the longest day she’s ever had because she did not know</br> what to expect.
                
                “Before I went for my maternity, sometime in January, I started telling my husband I don’t feel the strength I used to have. I don’t have the enthusiasm that I had before. I used to be very excited on Sunday mornings And I would leave the house and go to the office by 9 am,” she explained.
                
                What was hard for her is that she had been in the gospel show for six years.</br>
                
                She did not know how to process the news yet she was sure she would get back to work after </br>her maternity leave.
                
                “I was so confused literally because I was like I’m I supposed to be happy or sad? I know that there’s nothing God has ever done or allowed in my life that has been for nothing, but here I am wondering how to process this because I’ve known this life for six good years but now here it is, I’m not going to do it anymore. I’m on maternity and in my head, I knew when I finish I’m going back to work,” she said.
                
                Ekirapa hosted Crossover show every Sunday on NTV.</br>
                
                She earned her spot when she replaced NTV’s Cross Over 101 host, Faith Muturi Ngugi who </br>left the show to attend to family matters.
                
                Before joining the NTV show, Grace was a co-host to a similar show on KBC with Mr Tee called</br> Angaza.
                
                She described working with him as “a man full of wisdom and His hunger for God is one to envy</br>
