            <p2>When I was very new in the business
                I joined GIF as a student. </br> I worked part time then later switched to full 
                time…. before joining the GIF business I had tried many ways of making money.</br> 
                
                I worked with SONKO RESCUE TEAM during holidays just raise money to cater for my bills and 
                for sure I didn’t see myself achieving much..</br>  but currently, with this amazing platform, I can
                 confidently say that
                 it is the right vehicle for my dreams. </br> That’s why I chose to do this FULL Time.</br>

                This how I started off the business from the bottom
                Straight to the point……</br>  Seeing my family smile and changing the situation of the entire
                 family background has been and always will be one of my biggest and major DREAM since
                  I was young…</br>  Raised In NAIROBI, EASTLANDs area… in a family of 5, as the first born… 
                  We can all agree life is never easy….. Expecially when your guardian isn’t </br> 
                  financially STABLE, and everything is a struggle. But do I say , GIF has made 
                  it possible for me…. ATLEAST today as we speak… Apart from the money I’m making….</br>  My
                   Mum and siblings (2 sisters and 2 brothers) are living a comfortable life… THIS IS
                    A GAME Changer. Started with zero skills, zero experience, zero money.</br>  BUT WITH THE
                     CORRECT BUSINESS MINDSET. I decided to be coachable, teachable, and available to 
                     learn how the business works.</br>

                <h4>With my Team leaders</h4>
                And with the support of the leaders who were experienced and skilled….</br>  That’s how
                 I learnt my way to become the person I am today.</br>

            <p10>
                
                As we were celebrating our 9th anniversary as a company I was lucky enough</br> 
                 to get a profit share from the company. This was signed and awarded to me by our able CEO Mr Kimathi KAMUNDEH. I will always be grateful for this am much more I have achieved through global internet fortunes. 
                </br> 
                
                Am  Looking Forward to Achieving much more with GIF. And after working smart,</br>  saving the money I earn from the company I have managed to gift myself a Christmas gift that I had worked for. My First Brand New Car Subaru G4 KDE 320X. 
                
                
                
                3 years down the line I have been able to achieve a lot, </br> among them a brand new car , a Subaru G4  in the midst of a pandemic because you can never go wrong investing in the Internet .
                
                
                People always wonder why I chose Online Work over my Supply chain management Career</br>  .
                
                <h4>It’s Freedom For me, ie Time freedom.</h4> </br> 
                I don’t want to be bossed around being told what to do from Monday to Saturday, January</br>  to December, years after years, instead, I want to be my own boss where I’ll choose my working hours and write my own cheque .
                I hate being stuck in traffic especially on a rainy Monday morning.</br> 

                <img src="sonko15.jpg" alt="">
            </p10>
            <p11>I’m after financial freedom as well, I want to compress my working years,</br>  the goal is to retire young and richIf you need to take your life to the next financial level, ready to dare life itself and conquer, ready to achieve your dreams, own that dream home and car, live in your dream neighborhood and be able to live a limitless life then here is your golden opportunity.

                As I’m sharing my story am not here to brag but to inspire someone out here</br>  who’s desperately looking for a job or they’re not happy with their work, that online work is also work.
